# Notebooks
This is my repo for Jupyter notebooks that I want to share with other people:
- [An implementation of a simple Bayesian optimization algorithm.](https://github.com/jsaporta/Notebooks/blob/master/Parametric%20Model%20Example.ipynb)
- [A tutorial for how to use the dimensionality reduction method t-SNE.](https://github.com/jsaporta/Notebooks/blob/master/t-SNE%20Tutorial.ipynb)
