# Notebooks
This is my repo for Jupyter notebooks that I want to share with other people:
- [An implementation of a simple Bayesian optimization algorithm.](https://github.com/jsaporta/Notebooks/blob/master/Parametric%20Model%20Example.ipynb)
- [Slides for my presentation on convolutional neural networks to the data science reading group.](https://github.com/jsaporta/Notebooks/blob/master/Convolutional%20Neural%20Networks.ipynb)
- [A fun little description of the EM algorithm.](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jsaporta/Notebooks/blob/master/The%20EM%20Algorithm.ipynb)
